## 🧭 Top-Level Purpose

A lightweight, modular space for developer signals, notes, tools, and transmissions.

---

## 🧱 Signal Subsections (Angular Components as Pages)

| Route             | Purpose                                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `/`              | Signal Home (intro + live components feed)    |
| `/rss`           | XML feed + reader preview                     |
| `/devlog`        | Devlog viewer (syncs from GitHub or Markdown) |
| `/changelog`     | App-wide release notes                        |
| `/uptime`        | Ping / status check                           |
| `/echo`          | Test webhook / test post endpoint             |
| `/credits`       | Easter egg shoutout to you + the AI team      |
| `/lightmoreincense` | 🌸 Trigger sparkle or incense animation   |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Ideas

- **Angular standalone app** with minimal layout
- Pull content via:
  - `fetch()` from Markdown or JSON
  - GitHub Discussions API
  - Static YAML + YAML-to-HTML parser
- Add RSS feed generator with:
  - `feed.xml` generator script
  - Button to “subscribe”
- Could be hosted on **Cloudflare Pages** or **Vercel** with caching headers

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

If you're ready, we can scaffold:

- `/apps/signal.fahrnbach.one` folder
- Angular routes and stub components
- Devlog RSS + reader feed idea
- Easter eggs (like `/lightmoreincense`) for fun ✨
