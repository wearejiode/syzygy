**Live Site:** [fahrnbach.one](https://art.fahrnbach.one)  
**Repo:** [github.com/fahrnbach/portfolio-site](https://github.com/fahrnbach/portfolio-site)  

A minimalist, handcrafted personal website to showcase my journey, projects, and design sensibilities. 
Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Originally Built without frameworks (except for threejs), or dependencies;
Just code, creativity, and craftsmanship. (Now including backend services for genie-chat)

## 💡 Case Study

## 🧾 Overview
`fahrnbach.one` is my personal portfolio website built from scratch using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It serves as a central hub for my resume, project showcases, creative work, and professional background.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
As a self-taught developer and designer, I needed a place to unify my diverse skill sets — from front-end engineering to digital art and tech repair — into one polished, personal brand. I wanted it to load fast, look good, and be easy to update.

## 👨‍💻 My Role
I designed and developed the entire site — from layout, responsiveness, and custom JavaScript animations, to accessibility considerations and ongoing content updates.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Design**: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Performance**: Fully responsive and lightweight, designed for fast load times

## 🌟 Key Features
- Custom-built digital resume in plain text (keyboard-styled aesthetic)
- Accessible, responsive layout across devices
- SVG-based UI elements designed in Illustrator
- Modular sections (About, Projects, Resume) for ease of maintenance
- Minimal external dependencies — all handcrafted

## 🧠 Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Designing a fast-loading portfolio that didn’t rely on a framework.
  - **Solution**: Wrote modular, clean JavaScript for interactivity and layout logic, and optimized all graphics/SVGs.
- **Challenge**: Balancing design with accessibility.
  - **Solution**: Used semantic HTML and tested keyboard navigation and color contrast.

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Honed responsive design skills using pure CSS and media queries.
- Gained deep insight into structuring plain JavaScript apps without frameworks.
- Discovered the value of restraint — fewer dependencies means faster, more secure pages.

## 🔧 Next Steps
- Add case studies and project pages dynamically from a JSON file or CMS.
- Implement dark mode toggle with minimal JS overhead.
- Explore a lightweight search bar for project filtering.
