Sesame Portal

🌱 Phase 1: MVP - Sesame as a Magical Bio Page

Single-user dynamic pitch page, wired to JSON, images in R2

✅ Already done:
	•	Dynamic meta previews (Open Graph / Twitter cards)
	•	URL slug → loads personalized content from data.json
	•	Assets hosted via R2 (e.g., profile image, backgrounds)
	•	Custom design & layout (buttons, summary, embedded video)
	•	Wrangler deploy + R2 CLI wired up
	•	Future-proofed for multi-user 👀

🧩 Final MVP polish:
	•	Add optional GitHub + LinkedIn buttons
	•	Smooth entry animation
	•	Rewrite summary in slug-based JSON
	•	Add canonical meta tag
	•	Build /open as a fallback default route

🪴 Phase 2: Multi-User Support (Foundations)

Let others have their own pages too

🔧 Stack:
	•	Cloudflare D1 or KV (simple config storage)
	•	Extend data.json format into per-user objects
	•	Example:
```
  {
  "jacob": {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "links": [...],
    ...
  },
  "jessica": { ... },
  ...
}
```

✅ Worker will:
	•	Parse /jacob, /jessica, etc.
	•	Lookup their record → render OG preview + page

🔐 Optional:
	•	Add a slug.isPublic flag to control page visibility

⸻

🏗️ Phase 3: Admin Dashboard

So you can edit your page with a UI

🎨 Features:
	•	Login with GitHub / Magic Link (optional)
	•	Form to update: summary, links, video embed, image
	•	Upload directly to R2 (or via presigned URL)
	•	Live preview

Tech:
	•	Vanilla JS or Angular UI
	•	Auth via Cloudflare Access, Auth0, or password-only

⸻

🚪 Phase 4: Signup + Public Launch

Let users register and generate their own pages

🌍 New routes:
	•	/signup → create account
	•	/@username → live profile page
	•	/admin/@username → edit panel

📦 DB design (D1):
	•	users table: id, username, email, createdAt
	•	pages table: title, desc, links[], image, etc.

Optional paid features:
	•	Custom domain support (e.g. jacob.dev)
	•	Custom themes
	•	Analytics for clicks

⸻

🌌 Phase 5: ✨ Wonder & Delight ✨

Make it feel like magic

💡 Ideas:
	•	Genie mascot or sparkly micro-interactions
	•	AI-assist for writing summaries
	•	Shareable “badges” and moments (e.g., “Just Launched!”)
	•	A “Magic Link Generator” for custom intros
