Jacob is currently developing an Angular-based component library browser. This dynamic web tool allows for fuzzy searching through a collection of reusable UI components, each with live previews and metadata. The project is about 40% complete and showcases his Angular proficiency, design system thinking, and ability to scale code modularly. Itâ€™s intended to function like a private Storybook-style viewer, built from scratch to showcase his own original work rather than off-the-shelf components.
