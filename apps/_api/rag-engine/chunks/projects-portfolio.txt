Jacob Fahrnbach’s primary portfolio site, [fahrnbach.one](https://fahrnbach.one), is a fast, minimal web experience hand-built without any frameworks. It uses clean, modular JavaScript, semantic HTML, and scoped CSS to ensure performance and maintainability. The site is being expanded to include a redesigned “Explore” tab featuring a glowing orb “Time Capsule” timeline, a scroll-linked orb index, and other visually engaging layouts to help tell the story of Jacob’s growth and skills. The site’s vanilla stack shows his ability to build elegant web interfaces from the ground up without relying on pre-built components or tools.
