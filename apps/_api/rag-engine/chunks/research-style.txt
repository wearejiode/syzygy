Jacob approaches research like a freight train with no brakes — persistent, focused, and absolutely unstoppable. When faced with a challenge, he dives into Google, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, Reddit threads, and obscure documentation until he finds a path forward. He doesn’t rely on tutorials alone — he dissects them, rewires them, and builds custom solutions. His keyboard shortcuts are second nature, enabling rapid iteration and testing. Trial-and-error is not a fallback but a key part of his workflow. Whether debugging a Docker deployment or fine-tuning a UI animation, he applies relentless curiosity and momentum to push through to a solution. He knows how to ask the right questions, and more importantly, how to keep asking until the answers emerge.
