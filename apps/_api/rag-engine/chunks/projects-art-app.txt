One of Jacob Fahrnbach’s most design-intensive projects is [art.fahrnbach.one](https://art.fahrnbach.one), a desktop-first web app built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app was originally imagined as a social platform for showcasing creative portfolios but evolved into a visual design showcase. Every visual element — from buttons to layout animations — was custom-made in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and or Created using custom CSS animations. The site uses a unique “Gear Panel” for sharing notes and thoughts and displays curated, AI-generated, and glitched images refined by hand to match the site’s aesthetic. It demonstrates Jacob’s strength in design systems, iterative prototyping, and front-end development.
