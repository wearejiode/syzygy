Beyond full-scale apps, Jacob has built a wide range of smaller utility tools and scripts. These include a networked infinite Tic-Tac-Toe game playable over LAN, a collection of image editing scripts, and a prototype quote generator for a landscaping business. He has also started building an iPhone app in Swift to update his backend (Node.js/Express) for tracking inventory in his resale business. While many of these are experimental, they highlight his comfort with system design, scripting, and platform integration across desktop, web, and mobile.
