# 👣 Path for the Future

## ✅ Phase 1 — Unified auth-server
	•	Use JWTs or sessions
	•	Implement basic role-based middleware
	•	Store user records + roles in the DB

	Be able to:
	•	🔐 Register & login
	•	🪪 Issue JWTs or cookies
	•	👤 Protect private routes (e.g. /me, /posts/create)
	•	🔄 Refresh tokens if needed

## 🧱 Phase 2 — Add access-server
	•	Only if/when multiple roles/tenants grow
	•	It can be lightweight: a role/permission map with a /can endpoint
