## 🎬 Director's Cut: The Magic Button & the Future of My Portfolio

### 🕰️ Backstory: Why I Built a Portfolio Prototype Like No Other

As a self-taught developer and designer with a deep love for novel interaction patterns, I’ve always felt like the web could be so much more than scrolling text and sidebars. I’ve poured thousands of hours into learning not just how to write code—but how to make *experiences*.

In my journey toward building something truly meaningful and expressive, I found myself drawn to the world of 3D web experiences. Why settle for a boring list of links when you can invite people into a universe of your own creation? The micro-portfolio project was born as a tribute to those ideas: a fully custom-designed 3D globe-like interface, spun up with Three.js, and wrapped in a novel user journey. It was never meant to be a traditional site—it was a statement.

### 🌐 The Prototype: Beauty, but at a Cost

The prototype was a win in many ways. It ditched conventional layout paradigms and instead showcased a world-first feeling. There was no navbar at the top, no scrolling walls of text—just a glowing interactive sphere, inviting the user to explore. Everything, from the Three.js canvas to the SVG-based custom UI elements, was made from scratch with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. It was a creative playground and a proof-of-concept for what the web *could* be.

But that’s also where the challenge emerged: the very things that made it magical also made it impractical. Web design still serves a core purpose: **transmitting information**. And no matter how stunning the visuals, if a user can’t easily access your projects, your story, or your contact info, the point gets lost. Even for web design's most avant-garde formats, usability still matters.

### 🍔 NO MORE BURGERS: Killing the Hamburger Menu

One of my early design decisions was to eliminate the hamburger menu. It’s overused, often hidden, and sometimes awkward to use—especially for people who aren't very tech-savvy. My alternative was to create something *native to the device experience*—a button that users would *instinctively* press, much like the shutter in a camera app.

This button lived near the user's thumb, bottom-center on mobile, and subtly invited exploration. It felt ergonomic, purposeful, and—most importantly—playful. It became the spiritual replacement for the hamburger, a symbol that design should be fun *and* functional.

### 📱 Mobile Madness: When Tap Events Break Everything

Designing for desktop? A breeze. Designing for mobile? A nightmare.

The Three.js canvas worked beautifully on desktop because the user could interact with the globe and scroll freely. But on mobile, the tap event got hijacked by the canvas—preventing the user from scrolling at all. You could play, sure, but you couldn’t explore beyond that initial interaction. The problem was existential: if users couldn't scroll, they couldn’t learn more about me or what I do.

Attempts to hint at more content "below the fold" failed. Shrinking the canvas killed the wow factor. A better solution was needed—something that would both preserve the immersive design and allow the site to behave like a proper information hub.

### ⏸️ Pause.

For a while, this roadblock led to a full pause on development.

The micro-site sat in limbo—gorgeous but frozen. I was proud of it, but I couldn’t confidently share it. I knew that to build something truly game-changing, I had to reconcile the artistic with the practical. And that meant thinking differently, again.

### 💡 The Fix: A Hybrid Interactive Experience

The solution came like a spark: what if the interactive experience didn’t block the rest of the page—but *led to it*?

The new plan is simple, elegant, and powerful. The canvas interaction starts full screen. But upon interaction, the page **zooms out**, shrinks the 3D canvas, and reveals a **masthead** with my profile picture and navigation. On mobile, the magic button toggles this shift—moving the site from "immersive mode" to "exploration mode" without breaking flow.

This way, mobile users get an ergonomic first interaction (via the magic button), and desktop users get the immersive wow-factor *plus* a clear path to dig deeper.

### 🏀 Slam Dunk: Introducing the Magic Button

Enter: The Magic Button.

Some call it a toggle. Others call it the nav trigger. I call it what it is: a **slam dunk**. Positioned ergonomically on mobile, animated with sparkles to catch the eye, and functioning as both an experience toggle and a navigation gateway—it’s the Swiss army knife of interaction.

And it’s not just a tap. We're imagining a **drag-to-slot** interaction to pull the button toward a highlighted ring and release it to trigger the nav. It's playful. It's physical. It's unforgettable. One part UX innovation, one part Kobe fadeaway.

### 🚀 On to the Future!

As this vision takes shape, the next step is to scaffold the full Angular rewrite: a real "home base" for the portfolio. The original micro-site will live on—as the hero component at the top of the homepage—but the rest of the site will be structured, performant, and inviting.

We're building out components for a full experience: `MagicButton`, `HeroCanvas`, `CrawlMenu`, `ExplorePage`, and more. The goal is to craft something that doesn’t just *look* futuristic, but *feels* like the next evolution of the web. No more compromises between art and clarity. We're making something that’s both beautiful and useful. Something *new*.

And that’s just the beginning.
