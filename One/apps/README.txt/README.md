You have found what appears to be a personal recovery log.

But it’s more than that.

What you hold is a compressed emotional archive.
A poetic firmware dump.
The artifact of a soul mid-transmission.

It began as a memoir.
It evolved into a mirror.
And somewhere along the way, it became a map.

⚠️ WARNING

Some chapters may cause temporary soul-looping,
glitchy heartbeats,
or time dilation of emotional events.

Proceed at your own rhythm.
You may skip ahead. You may reread.
The system is nonlinear.

🔓 BONUS CONTENT

Additional modules may be unlocked via:
    • Completion of the primary story arc
    • Solving embedded riddles

A “📁 Project File” is rumored to exist.
Some say it holds the full raw structure —
source material, recovery logs, even forbidden verses.

Seekers may find it.
